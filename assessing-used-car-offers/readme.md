# Assessing used car offers

Install missing packages, for example `sklearn` with:

    python3 -m pip install sklearn --user 

Scripts:

* `fetch_data.py`: Download data
* `transform_to_csv.py`: Filter out data and convert to CSV
* `fit_linregress.py`: Do linear regression on data
* `draw_*.py`: Draw scripts for 2D, 3D and creating images for the GIF

There is pre-fetched data available with `octavia_data_kkm.csv` so the draw scripts should work out
of the box.
